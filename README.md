# Lines and Polygons Viewer

This project implements a geometry viewer using Javascript, in which it is possible to arrange and manipulate lines and polygons. Left-clicking the edge of a line allows you to reposition this edge. Right-clicking anywhere in the line a new line on the click location. Left-clicking the middle of a line moves the whole line. You can also type a number between 3 and 8 in the prompt to generate a polygon with the desired number of sides. The actions described above are also possible to perform on the polygon.
